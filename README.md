# Blue Funding
 Copy Trading Automation

BlueFunding was meant to be a copy trade automation using the public futures leaderboards data in Binance Cryptocurrency Exchange. 

Binance recently blocked the public data for this. You have to log in using a 2FA to see the data. I used an HTTPClient before to access it for free but now I have no use for this code anymore. Therefore I wanted it to go public.
