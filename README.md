# Blue Funding
 Copy Trading Automation

BlueFunding was meant to be a copy trade automation using the public futures leaderboards data in Binance Cryptocurrency Exchange. 

Binance recently blocked the public data for this. You have to log in using a 2FA to see the data. I used an HTTPClient before to access it for free but now I have no use for this code anymore. Therefore I wanted it to go public. 

What the code does is it browses the leaderboard page for your specified traders. You have to put the trader's unique ID code from your browser to the code manually. Afterwards, whenever the trader opens a position in his account, you will get the same position opened in your own account but with modified parameters that you can customize. Such as amount, market/limit order, stop loss.. etc.
